# Kaggle

In this repository, I work with Kaggle datasets and competitions.

These projects include mostly combinations of exploratory analysis, experimental design, and predictive modeling.

## Current competition: [home_credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

1. [instacart](instacart/instacart.ipynb)
2. [marketing_bank](marketing_bank/marketing_bank.ipynb)
3. [sales_forecast](sales_forecast/sales_forecast.ipynb)
4. [wine_class](wine_class/wine_class.ipynb)
5. [youtube_EDA](youtube_EDA/youtube_EDA.ipynb)

### 1. [instacart](instacart/instacart.ipynb)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis

#### Description
In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. 

#### My Use
Some in depth EDA. 

### 2. [marketing_bank](marketing_bank/marketing_bank.ipynb)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bank-marketing

#### Description
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

#### My Use
Some EDA as well as a predictive modeling.

### 3. [sales_forecast](sales_forecast.ipynb)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-final-project

#### Description
In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.

#### My Use
Some EDA as well as predictive modeling.

### 4. [wine_class](wine_class.ipynb)
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

#### Description
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

#### My Use
Some EDA as well as predictive modeling.

### 5. [youtube_EDA](youtube_EDA/youtube_EDA.ipynb)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

#### Description
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.

#### My Use
Some simple EDA
